# QuickSign

QuickSign is a simple web application I built while learning modern frontend development. This project uses **Vite** for fast development, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and the core logic is written in **vanilla JavaScript**.

## Features

- Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and build times
- Styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first, responsive design
- All application logic is implemented in vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and learning purposes

## About

This project was created as a hands-on way to explore and practice frontend technologies. It serves as a personal learning journey into modern tooling and best practices.

## Future Improvements

Some features are still in progress and will be improved over time as I continue to learn and develop my skills.
